                   "Hero's Age: 154"
                   "Hero's Power: physical strength"
                   "Hero's Weakness: Anger issues"

**The program should return when the user creates a hero** 

    Output Example: "Hero Name: Hulk"
                    "Hero's Age: 154"
                    "Hero's Power: physical strength"
                    "Hero's Weakness: Anger issues"
